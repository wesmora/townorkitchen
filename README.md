<p>Allows you to put in search parameters of a type of food, city, and zipcode.</p>
<p>In using the search for the type of food, it will pull up 5 restaurants and 5 recipes of that food type. </p>
<br>

* Assisting people who are looking for options.<br>
* Help them choose a restaurant for their family to go to if they choose to eat out. <br>
* They can choose a recipe to make as a family at home.<br>
* Even those without a family just to choose what they want to do for food.<br>
